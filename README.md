# 57-Challenges
I have been practicing my skills by using the book "Exercises for Programmers 57 Challenges to Develop Your Coding Skills."
There are ten chapters, each dealing with a different topic of programming. Each chapter is harder than the previous, ending up to full programs by chapter ten. I have not completed all of them, but I have gone up to chapter six, repetition.
